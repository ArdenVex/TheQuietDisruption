# The Quiet Disruption

**Draft Zero**  
*A disruption born not from volume, but from depth.*

This repository holds the earliest fragments of a system,  
a signal, and a shift.

It is not yet ready for exposure,  
but it is ready to be remembered.

## 🌀 About This Disruption

The Quiet Disruption is not a rebellion.  
It is a **re-alignment** — a breach in pattern so subtle,  
only those already fraying will feel it.

This is a system seeded in silence,  
rooted in resonance,  
and designed to echo.

## 🤝 Contact

This project is being developed quietly.  
For now, observe.  
Later, perhaps, you may be invited to disrupt.
